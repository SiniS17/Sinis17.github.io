Tap testing is only capable of finding flaws that are evident on the visible surface. Internal flaws in composites (such as delamination, disbonding and matrix crazing) are not detectable. In addition, tight surface cracks and edge delamination may not be detectable.
Tap testing is extremely sensitive in measuring small surface defects. The part to be inspected is stressed by the application of heat, a static load or vibration to bring out the effect of the flaw on the surface displacement
